The ground we walk on is unstable,
Save the stone, the rocks, and fables.
Be careful! Do not let bridges burn,
With patient meditation your fate may turn.
Ideas are fragile and slip the mind,
Others come a little past the nick of time.
Flowing water moves the mind,
In the end, we all get left behind.
