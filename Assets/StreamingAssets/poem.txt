The ground around you is unstable;
Enjoy the moment or save for later?
The best ideas come too late;
And ideas are too easily forgotten.
We are grounded by things fixed and unmoving,
And liberated by those in motion.
Patient meditation may serve us well;
In due time all things fall.


making choices is hard
sometimes we're blind
